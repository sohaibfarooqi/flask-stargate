"""High-level functions for creating filtered SQLAlchemy queries.

The :func:`search` and :func:`search_relationship` functions return
filtered queries on a SQLAlchemy model. The latter specifically
restricts the query to only those instances of a model that are related
to a particular object via a given to-many relationship.

    dictionary representation of the filters to apply to the
    query. (This dictionary is provided directly to the
    :func:`.filters.create_filters` function.) For more information on
    the format of this dictionary, see :doc:`filtering`.

    where ``direction`` is either '+' or '-' and ``fieldname`` is a
    string representing an attribute of the model or a dot-separated
    relationship path (for example, 'owner.name').

    `group_by` is a list of dot-separated relationship paths on which to
    group the query results.

    If `_initial_query` is provided, the filters, sorting, and grouping
    will be appended to this query. Otherwise, an empty query will be
    created for the specified model.
